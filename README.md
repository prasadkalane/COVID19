# COVID19
My Self Prasad Kalane. I am working in the field of Image Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and deep learning form 7 years. Recently I started my work on Covid-19. How I will contribute my experience towards an epidemic.So I develop 4 projects on Corona.

1] COVID-19 Detection from Lung CT imagery using AI --Deep Learning Approach
             In this project I used Lung CT scan images to detect Coronavirus. Also how this method can replace traditional RT-PCR testing is shown.

2] Prediction of COVID-19 in India using AI
          I this project I forecast the corona spreaad in next 2 days

3] COVID-19 Detection using A.I.
             In this project I create screen tool which takes input from patient and predict whether this person is healthy or have cold flu or Corona symptoms.
This project is useful for people  when they have general symptom. If screening tool confirm its corona symptoms then he must have to go for Confirmation test.

4] An Intuitive WSN Approach For Slowing The Spread Of CORONAVIRUS
                In this project we track the contact of the corona patient and send notification for them to do Corona test. Also we monitor quarantine people by continuously checking their position and health parameter. If healthy people came in contact with quarantine then we will send notification alert to healthy people. Also areas visited by infected people are inform to sanitize.
